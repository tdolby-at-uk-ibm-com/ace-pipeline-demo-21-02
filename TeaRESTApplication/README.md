# Tea index REST application

This application presents a minimal REST API for storing and retrieving different types of tea.

Basic curl commands to store and retrieve a type of tea:
```
curl -X POST --data '{"name": "Assam", "strength": 5}' http://173.193.79.84:31531/tea/index
curl http://173.193.79.84:31531/tea/index/1
```

Can be run locally as well as in the cloud, and for full details this repo should be pulled into an ACE 11.0.0.11 toolkit (via egit-4.11) and examined there.

## Implementation

POST subflow:

![POST subflow](post-index-subflow.png)

The main database logic is implemented in the "UpdateDB" subflow, and the audit logging in "LogAuditData", with both of these residing in TeaSharedLibrary for easier testing. "MapToNewFormat" is a mapping node that converts from an older schema ("milk": true/false instead of "strength":number) into the new schema; the map is contained in this application, and testing it is left as an exercise for the reader . . .


GET subflow:

Similar to the POST subflow, the main logic is in subflows in TeaSharedLibrary.
